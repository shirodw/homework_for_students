Cats are far more similar to their wild ancestors than dogs are to wolves, so dogs are in that sense the more domesticated of the two species.
As they adapted to living alongside humans, cats became more sociable with one another and much more accepting of people, but there is no evidence that they have changed much more than that over the past few thousand years.
Cats purr because they have something to say, which roughly translated is please keep still and pay attention to me.
Kittens purr to persuade their mothers to keep on nursing them, and pet cats purr when they want to be stroked.
